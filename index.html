            <p style="color:whitesmoke">Our Team 63 consists of four talented students who are majoring in Information Technology at ADA University. Our cohesion as a team has been formed through collaborative efforts on group assignments where we had to work together to achieve goals. We mastered fundamental knowledge in programming, technology, and computer science together. 
            As a prime example of our collective efforts, our second homework assignment focused on immersing ourselves in the world of programming using games on <a style="color:rgb(243, 243, 91)" href="Code.org"> Code.org</a>. This assignment helped us improve our coding skills, and further prove how important interactive and engaging methods are in learning complex concepts. We participated in the Hour of Code event, where we taught children how to code using games. This experience enriched our understanding of coding practices and their application in the real world. 
            We continue to explore numerous aspects in the field of technology and strive to apply what we have learned to solve practical problems in the ever-evolving field of computer science.
